## 🔹 Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to apply **agentic AI to financial analysis**, automating the research and reporting process for financial firms. In this case, I focused on Morgan Stanley.

The workflow is designed to simulate the work of a **junior financial analyst**, delivering concise, professional reports that highlight company performance, opportunities, and market outlook — exactly the kind of deliverables recruiters and consulting managers expect to see.  

The system uses two agents:
- **Researcher Agent** → Collects structured insights (financial health, services, risks, opportunities, outlook).  
- **Analyst Agent** → Transforms insights into a **polished one-page financial analyst brief** with executive summary, analysis, and conclusions.
